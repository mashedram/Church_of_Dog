TODO:
- The [[Singularity Collapse]] is an event in which [[Godhood]], and the first soul containing this, came to be.
- Consumed all the diverse multitudes of universe existing and turning it into a singular universe.
- Things that fell into rifts back then, continued to exist till this day in a sort of time-stasis.

On a wishful day, [[Seraphos]] made a deal with [[Alan]] to obtain the ability to create his own world in exchange for his Soul. [[Alan]] expecting a good deal out of this, gratefully accepted.

What [[Alan]] did not know, was that [[Seraphos]] made his world completely untouchable to [[Alan]]s will. [[Alan]], furious by this outcome, decided to rip everything in the [[Old World]] apart before [[Seraphos]] eyes. Saying that if he ever left his domain, he'd rip his [[Soul]] to shreds. 

During this display of power, [[Alan]] bended space and time to form the [[Ethereal Planes]] from the [[Old World]].
