The [[Ethereal Planes]] is what's left of the old world. A cluster of interconnected worlds, seemingly stretching endlessly. From magical forests to scorching deserts filled with white sand, the [[Ethereal Planes]] has it all. However, time and space is unpredictable here, and to wander without a guide is suicide.

Travel to and from the planes can only be done so through rifts, these rifts are often made while interacting with items coming from the [[Old World]], or created by it's power. Think of:
- Crystals used for [[DSA-01]]
- [[Seraphos]] soul
- [[Malphoros]] power ([[Godhood]])

The [[Ethereal Planes]] has an array of dangers:
- Randomly opening rifts, transporting whomever is in their radius to unpredictable locations
- Time vacuums; invisible spaces where time is stopped, slowed or sped up.
- Flora and Fauna of worlds and ecosystems that never should have collided.
