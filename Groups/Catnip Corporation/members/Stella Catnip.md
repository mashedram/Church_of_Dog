## Formal Data:
Name: Stella Catnip
Age: 41 (FIX)

Member of: [[Catnip Corporation]]
Position: Corporation Head

## Companions
## Boris:
A sentient cat, grey in fur with orange eyes. Although being of higher intelligence, he doesn't seem to talk. [[Stella Catnip]] seems to understand him, though. What is unknown to most, is that the cat is a deity from a higher plane, lacking control in this one, so he shares his power to one that can use it. He has formed a pact with [[Stella Catnip]] for similar goals as hers, take down [[Malphoros]]

## Characteristics:
A bubbly and joyful woman on the outside, a mask over a history of loss, scars and fate.
Female, standing 176 cm's in height. She has long, red hair and grey eyes. She's a very stylish person, dressing to impress. Although she is in her forties, she looks and has the physical abilities of someone closer to their late twenties.

She refuses to talk about her past, even when inquired to or threatened with harm or death. She is willing to open to those she trusts dearly.

Sees the relationship between [[Catnip Corporation]] and [[Church of Dog]] as purely financial, and does not wish their support or interference in any way, shape, or form.

## Backstory:
Born apart of a rich family, tightly enclosed in the cities military leadership. She was born a leader, often playing the role of one in any games she played as a child.

At the age of eighteen of twenty, she became an officer in the military through the connections her father has. Proving herself for two whole years, aiming to follow in his footsteps.

The murder upon [[Seraphos]] occurred only a month after her twenty-third birthday, fighting the good fight, she helped prepare against the newly formed organisation taking over [[East Prophitia]], threatening to follow with the west.

But the tides don't wait for noon, and soon, the [[The Seraphos Extermination]] had began. A lot of cities within [[West Prophitia]] were hit, and evacuation shelters were constructed in the remaining cities, one of those being the one [[Stella Catnip]] inhabited. The cities defences being to strong for the [[The Rat Association (TRA)]] to penetrate, seeing the extended preparation time that was giving due to the cities western location. However, almost all of the high-ranking military personnel, including her dad, were assassinated by insiders, and military structure was eventually lost.

Together with a few of her kin, she constructed the [[Catnip Corporation]], with her at the head of it's stool. With her and her command, she made Catnip grow quick, forming new allies, helping those in need of shelter, and generally being an opposing force upon [[The Rat Association (TRA)]].

She did not sit still, and eventually expanded towards a scientific branch. Researching and developing whatever was needed. In the year of 6 ACY, she even found enough time to have a wife and kid.

However, within the year of 13 ACY, a raid upon [[West Prophitia]] organised by the [[The Rat Association (TRA)]] found her leading the front lines, the force was fought of, but when she came home, she found her wife mortally wounded and her son beheaded. Her wife died in hospitals a day later due to internal bleeding.

She left duty for half a year, burying her lost ones and taking her time to grief. She swore to be the destruction of the one that harmed her, and others, so much. During this period, she met a deity from a higher plane, and since their goals aligned, he offered her power in exchange for an oath to achieve her goal, even in exchange for her own life. So she agreed.
## Special Items:
- A wedding ring of her deceased wife.
- A hanger with a family photo around her neck.
- Boris is not actually called: "Boris", but since [[Stella Catnip]] can't pronounce the actual name, she uses: "Boris"

## Trivia:
- Is using a method to slow her aging process.
- Uses unknown anomalous items to achieve abilities equal to magical abilities from story books, as an oath to her child, who loved those stories.
