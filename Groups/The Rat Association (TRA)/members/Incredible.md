Leader of the [[The Rat Association (TRA)]], and thus, has a God complex.

He is in direct contact with the [[Malphoros]] himself, and acts as the mesiah (OR WHATEVER YOU CALL THAT).

Is the only one who has obtained the power that [[Malphoros]] promised them, although only partially (EXPAND ON THIS).

TODO:
- Make his personality more of a planned narcistic and psychopathic one, but also charismatic
- Make him and [[Malphoros]] be in a sort of "mutually beneficial" relationship
