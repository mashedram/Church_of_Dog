[[Black Dogs]] is the elite of the elite when it comes to the [[Church of Dog]]'s forces, it's primary task is report directly to the [[Council of Dog]] and are used for PMC/Missionary work otherwise.

They have direct access to most of the [[Church of Dog]]'s military funding, although their PMC work also fills most of the funding.

Primary tactic is to choose Chaos over Origination to confuse the enemy.
Quote Shiba: "If we don't know what we are doing, the enemy doesn't either."

The team uses: "Bruh You" as a general form of things like 'Bless you'. It's part of 'Dog Ethics' 

NOTES:
- Team refuses to use any squad marking colour other than orange
- Chants: "IN DOG WE TRUST!" during missions, seeing the teams goal is to spread knowledge of the old order, aka [[Church of Dog]]
