# Backstory
\[CLASSIFIED]

[[Kite]]'s upbringing was unknown, he was part of one of the refuge centres after [[The Seraphos Extermination]]. Missing both his parents at the young age of thirteen.

He was taken in to separate care after an unknown object was found upon him (later designated [[HV-361]]). It was initially missed due to the massive amounts of refugees fleeing to the [[Country of YES]].

Although [[Kite]] claimed to have had the arm for a long time, his experience with it was quite low, seeing that he was unable to do anything with it other than moving it around like one'd suspect a normal arm to do.

Over a period of time, he seemed to gain quite the skills with it, given the fact that the [[Church of Dog]] gave him all the time and space to do so.

He esteemed to use his newfound power for good, and decided to join the [[Military Branch]] at the age of eighteen as a medic. Using his capability to create herbs to his liking as medicine.

He fought bravely, and helped many. During this time period, he spent a lot of effort into perfecting his ability, both in combat and on the medical aspect of it all.

At the age of twenty-one, he hit a low point within his life. All the violence got to his head and he started to use his abilities to create a set of self-administered drugs to supress his depression and make him generally feel better. Although these herbs where not dangerous to his health, the following addiction, was.

After being forcefully discharged from the field for medical reasons at the age of twenty-three, seeing that his newfound addiction was causing heavy damages to others, as well as his mental health. He was put into therapy, and due to the fact that his source of supplements was physically attached to him, he was also put onto constant monitoring.

He eventually came over his problems, and managed to completely loose his condition. This was apart of him using the same capabilities that gave him said herbs, to medicate himself into kicking off. This came with the help of a group of other scientists. He had completely stopped, only using his herbs to recreationally smoke once or twice a month.

At the age of twenty-seven, he met [[Ethan]], who had just been released from the [[Project Infusion]] laboratories. They were placed within the same unit when they both joined the [[Military Branch]], and became quite the good pair on the battlefield, covering each others weaknesses

At the age of twenty-eight, [[Kite]] met [[Lucy]] at a bar. They got along well, and after a successful night out, they started dating. During this period, they were often far apart, which was eventually remedied by [[Kite]] leaving the main battle force of the [[Military Branch]] to join the [[Red Right Paw]] in 18 ACY, which he was recommended for by [[Lucy]].

They were originally part of [[Squad 3]], which [[Kite]] got [[Ethan]] accepted into about a month later with the help of his partner. They were quite the trio, and got along well, this eventually led to the idea of their own squad, which [[Lucy]] originally threw around drunk, during a night of drinking. She followed through, however, and ended up creating [[Squad 7]], with [[Lucy]] at the lead in 19 ACY.

They have been in active duty there since.
